#🛰️ Land Use & Land Cover Classification

This project uses deep learning to classify land use and land cover (LULC) from satellite imagery. The model is trained on the EuroSAT dataset using a ResNet50 CNN model to distinguish between different land types such as forests, water bodies, urban areas, and agricultural land.

🚀 Features

🖼️ Classifies satellite images into LULC categories
🧠 Deep learning-based approach using ResNet50
📊 Trained on the EuroSAT dataset
🔍 Preprocessing and feature extraction techniques applied
📈 Evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics

🛠️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python (Core programming language)
📒 Jupyter Notebook (Development environment)
🧠 TensorFlow / Keras (Deep learning framework)
🖼️ OpenCV / PIL (Image processing)
🔢 NumPy & Pandas (Data handling)
📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

📂 Dataset

Dataset Used: EuroSAT RGB (jpg format)
Classes: Residential, Industrial, Forest, Water, Agricultural land, etc.
